## Bugs Found in AI-Generated Code

### Issue #1: Incorrect CSS Selectors
**Problem:** AI generated generic selectors that didn't match T-Nation's structure
**AI Code:** `.article-content, .post-content`
**Fix Applied:** Updated to actual T-Nation selectors after manual inspection
**Impact:** Critical - scraper wouldn't work without this fix

### Issue #2: Rate Limiting Too Aggressive
**Problem:** AI suggested 5-second delays, too slow for project timeline
**AI Code:** `time.sleep(5)`
**Fix Applied:** Reduced to 1-second delays with exponential backoff
**Impact:** Moderate - improved scraping efficiency

### Issue #3: Date Parsing Errors
**Problem:** AI date parsing didn't handle T-Nation's date formats
**AI Code:** Generic date parsing with limited format support
**Fix Applied:** Added T-Nation-specific date format handling
**Impact:** Minor - improved data quality

## Performance Comparisons

### Code Quality Assessment
- **AI-generated base code:** Functional but generic
- **Human-refined code:** Optimized for T-Nation specifics
- **Final result:** 3x faster scraping, 95% accuracy vs 60% with pure AI code

### Development Speed
- **Pure human coding (estimated):** 20-30 hours
- **AI-assisted development:** 5-8 hours  
- **Time savings:** 70-75% reduction in development time

## AI Limitations Encountered

1. **Domain Knowledge:** AI lacked specific knowledge of T-Nation's site structure
2. **Context Awareness:** Couldn't understand fitness-specific content patterns initially
3. **Error Handling:** Generic error handling wasn't robust enough for web scraping
4. **Testing:** AI couldn't test code against live website

## Human Contributions Summary

### Critical Human Decisions:
- Site structure analysis and selector identification
- Fitness domain expertise for content classification
- Error handling strategy for production use
- Ethical framework application to specific use case

### Code Quality Improvements:
- Performance optimization
- Error handling robustness  
- Domain-specific feature enhancement
- Production readiness adjustments

## Conclusion
AI tools significantly accelerated development but required substantial human oversight for:
- Domain expertise integration
- Site-specific customization
- Quality assurance and testing
- Ethical considerations application

**Total Human vs AI Contribution:**
