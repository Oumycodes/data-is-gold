Problem Statement
There is no centralized, affordable source of real-time fitness science updates (new exercise protocols, nutrition research, supplement effectiveness, gym equipment trends). Athletes, personal trainers, and fitness app developers waste hours manually searching blogs, academic journals, and fitness websites for the latest information.
Potential Data Product
A web scraper that aggregates structured data from:
Fitness research news sites (e.g., PubMed abstracts for exercise/nutrition).


Gym equipment / supplement review sites (pricing, ratings, new releases).


Workout forums / Q&A sites (most-discussed exercises, emerging trends).


Output: A clean dataset with latest validated findings + trends, updated daily or weekly.
Who Pays (Potential Users & Buyers)
Personal trainers & gyms → they want to differentiate by offering evidence-based workouts.


Fitness app developers (SaaS) → to power recommendation engines and keep users engaged.


Supplements & equipment companies → for competitor tracking and product positioning.
Market Size Estimate (ballpark)
Global fitness industry = ~$96B (2024, Statista).


Fitness apps market = ~$16B and growing at 20% CAGR.


Even if only 1% of app companies (approx. 5,000 globally) pay $100/month for structured data → that’s $500k ARR opportunity.
Why Not Already Available?
APIs like PubMed exist, but they’re clunky, slow, and require manual filtering.


Commercial APIs (e.g., supplement/fitness product datasets) are expensive or incomplete.
